## Module 14 Homework belly-button-challenge
### Description:
This is the Module 14 Homework belly-button-challenge for using html, css and javascript. Data was to be loaded using D3.json.  

### Getting started:
This challenge has 1 project called: belly-button-challenge. It contains starter code for the index.hmtl file which enables to display of the maps as per the javascript code written in the app.js starter code file. 

### Installations required:
These projects have been run in a Windows 11 GitBash environment, using Python 3.10.13 together with Visual Studio Code.

### Executing Homework Challenge Requirements:
Please see the index.html file and app.js file for the very limited code I was able to understand and complete for this challenge.  

Initially, I had a lot of trouble with a D3 not defined error, when trying to get the javascript code to run. Despite reviewing the call lesson recordings, I was not able to resolve this issue. 
I eventually changed the starter code, to use a different way of importing/reading the data.  

So I was finally able to get the index.html file to open the webpage, based on the app.js javasrcipt file.  I could then inspect the web page and got to the console, where I was finally able to see the metedata, names and samples lists. 

As a result, only a very limited amount of the challenge was completed, despite many hours reviewing the class recordings and the class exercises.
